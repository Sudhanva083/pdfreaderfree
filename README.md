Welcome to the PDF Reader with Voice Support, a web application designed to enhance your reading experience by converting PDF text into audible speech. Whether you need to listen to your documents while multitasking or have accessibility needs, this tool provides an intuitive and user-friendly solution.

Features:
Easy PDF Upload:

Users can upload PDF files directly from their device using a simple file input.
Supported PDFs should have selectable text for direct extraction.
Voice Reading:

Once a PDF is uploaded, the application reads the text aloud using built-in text-to-speech functionality.
If the PDF contains non-selectable text (e.g., scanned images), the tool performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract and read the text.
Visual Feedback:

A prominent note informs users to select a PDF with selectable text for optimal results.
If OCR is needed, the application provides feedback and performs the necessary text extraction.
Clean and Modern Design:

The interface features a calming gradient background, a well-organized container for content, and a clean layout for ease of use.
The note is highlighted with a soft red background to ensure visibility and user awareness.
Responsive and Accessible:

The design is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
User-friendly buttons and clear instructions facilitate smooth interaction with the application.
How It Works:
Upload Your PDF:

Select a PDF file using the file input field. Ensure it has selectable text for the best results.
Read Aloud:

Click the "Read PDF Aloud" button to start the reading process.
The application displays the PDF on the page and starts reading the text aloud.
Handling Non-Selectable Text:

If the PDF does not have selectable text, the application will automatically perform OCR to read the content.
A notification will inform you if OCR is being used.
Note:
Select a PDF with Selectable Text: For the best experience, please choose a PDF file where the text can be selected. This allows for direct extraction and more accurate reading.
This web application is a helpful tool for those looking to convert PDF text into spoken words, making it easier to access and comprehend documents on the go. Enjoy a streamlined and accessible reading experience with our PDF Reader with Voice Support!
